The SQL queries performed on the data set were used to:

Display the names of the unique launch sites in the space mission \n
Display 5 records where launch sites begin with the string ‘CCA’ \n
Display the total payload mass carried by boosters launched by NASA (CRS) \n
Display the average payload mass carried by booster version F9 v1.1 \n
List the date when the first successful landing outcome on a ground pad was achieved \n
List the names of the boosters that had success on a drone ship and a payload mass between 4000 and 6000 kg \n
List the total number of successful and failed mission outcomes \n
List the names of the booster versions that have carried the maximum payload mass \n
List the failed landing outcomes on drone ships, their booster versions, and launch site names for 2015 \n
Rank the count of landing outcomes (such as Failure (drone ship) or Success (ground pad)) between the dates 2010-06-04 and 2017-03-20, in descending order \n
**Sample Data Visualization** \n
Create a bar graph on Orbit based on the distribution of average payload mass \n
Create a Pie chart on Orbit based on its frequency in the dataset \n
Create a bar chart on Orbit based on the sum of Successful Mission_Outcome as referred to the Launch sites \n
14 . Create a heat map on the frequency of the Launch site and Orbits \n
