The SQL queries performed on the data set were used to:

Display the names of the unique launch sites in the space mission <br>
Display 5 records where launch sites begin with the string ‘CCA’ <br>
Display the total payload mass carried by boosters launched by NASA (CRS) <br>
Display the average payload mass carried by booster version F9 v1.1 <br>
List the date when the first successful landing outcome on a ground pad was achieved <br>
List the names of the boosters that had success on a drone ship and a payload mass between 4000 and 6000 kg <br>
List the total number of successful and failed mission outcomes <br>
List the names of the booster versions that have carried the maximum payload mass <br>
List the failed landing outcomes on drone ships, their booster versions, and launch site names for 2015 <br>
Rank the count of landing outcomes (such as Failure (drone ship) or Success (ground pad)) between the dates 2010-06-04 and 2017-03-20, in descending order <br>
**Sample Data Visualization** <br>
Create a bar graph on Orbit based on the distribution of average payload mass <br>
Create a Pie chart on Orbit based on its frequency in the dataset <br>
Create a bar chart on Orbit based on the sum of Successful Mission_Outcome as referred to the Launch sites <br>
Create a heat map on the frequency of the Launch site and Orbits <br>
